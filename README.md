# MassStock

Magento 1.x module that adds a REST call to mass update the product stock levels.

There are also two other auxiliary modules:

## CsvAdapter

Adds a CSV interpreter to Magento's REST interface, so that all REST apis are able to receive calls with CSV content.

## MassStockTest

Adds a frontend controller with an interface to authenticate via OAuth, and to make requests to MassStock's REST interface.
